This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# options
options(timeout = 1e6)
sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
```

```{r}
# import sites
ca_si <- readr::read_csv("data/data_papers/ATLANTIC_CAMTRAPS_1-0_LOCATION.csv") %>% 
    dplyr::select(location_id, X, Y)
ca_si
```

```{r}
# import sites names
ca_si_na <- readr::read_csv("data/data_papers/ATLANTIC_CAMTRAPS_1-0_SURVEY.csv") %>% 
    dplyr::left_join(., ca_si, by = "location_id") %>% 
    dplyr::select(location_id, survey_id, yearfinish,  X, Y)
ca_si_na
```


```{r}
# import species names
ca_sp_na <- readr::read_csv("data/data_papers/ATLANTIC_CAMTRAPS_1-0_SPECIES.csv") %>% 
    dplyr::select(order:genus, species_name, species_code)
ca_sp_na

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
